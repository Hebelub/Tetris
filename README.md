| Action       | Left Player | Center Player | Right Player |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Turn         | W           | I             | ↑            |
| Move Left    | A           | J             | ←            |
| Fall Fast    | S           | K             | ↓            |
| Move Right   | D           | L             | →            |
| Instant Drop | Left Ctrl   | Space         | Enter        |

Each player's controls are designed to provide an intuitive and comfortable gaming experience, allowing for quick reactions and strategic play. Ensure you're familiar with your player position's controls for the best gaming experience.
